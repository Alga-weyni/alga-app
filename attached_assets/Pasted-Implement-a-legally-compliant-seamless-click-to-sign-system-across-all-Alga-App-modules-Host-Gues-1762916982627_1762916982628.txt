Implement a legally compliant, seamless click-to-sign system across all Alga App modules (Host, Guest, Dellala, and Service Provider) in full alignment with:
	•	Electronic Signature Proclamation No. 1072/2018
	•	Electronic Transactions Proclamation No. 1205/2020

⸻

✅ Core Requirements

Replit must ensure:
	1.	Consent Component
	•	Create a single, reusable React component named ElectronicSignatureConsent.
	•	Display the following legal text verbatim:
“By clicking ‘I Agree,’ you consent that this action constitutes your electronic signature under Ethiopian law (Proclamations No. 1072/2018 and No. 1205/2020).”
	•	Style it using Alga’s default Tailwind palette.
	•	Include a primary confirmation button labeled “I Agree” and an optional link to “View Terms.”
	•	This component must render at the end of every key user action:
	•	Host registration
	•	Guest booking confirmation
	•	Dellala (agent) commission agreement
	•	Service provider contract acceptance
	2.	Legal Traceability
	•	On every click event, capture and securely store:
	•	user_id, action, timestamp, ip_address, device_info, and otp_id (if available).
	•	Insert data into a consent_logs table (if not existing, create one).
	•	Encrypt sensitive fields (IP, device) before storage.
	•	Implement automated backup to ensure logs are immutable and auditable.
	3.	Reliability and Identity Verification
	•	Integrate Fayda ID and OTP verification hooks where available.
	•	Require verified sessions before signature recording.
	•	Automatically reject unsigned or unverifiable actions.
	4.	Frontend Integration
	•	Ensure the consent component cannot be bypassed (mandatory acceptance).
	•	Disable the primary action button until user clicks “I Agree.”
	•	Confirm visual and UX consistency across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
	5.	Backend Logging
	•	Create /api/electronic-signature endpoint to handle all log events.
	•	Include validation middleware for user_id and timestamp.
	•	Return JSON response {success:true,signatureId:UUID}.
	•	Automatically retry once if database latency exceeds 2 seconds.
	6.	Data Integrity
	•	Hash the combination of user_id + action + timestamp (SHA-256) to generate a unique signature token.
	•	Store token in a column signature_hash for later verification.
	•	Enable read-only access for audit retrieval.
	7.	PDF Export (Optional)
	•	Auto-generate a simple PDF receipt (using pdfkit or native library) summarizing:
	•	User name
	•	Action signed
	•	Date and time
	•	Signature token
	•	Legal statement reference
	8.	Compliance Notes
	•	Reference INSA as the regulatory authority.
	•	Support offline cache for audit continuity if internet connection fails.
	•	Ensure GDPR-style data retention limits (5 years default).

🚫 What to Avoid
	•	Do not add visible signature pads or handwritten drawing fields.
	•	Do not use third-party paid APIs (DocuSign, HelloSign, etc.).
	•	Do not expose private Fayda IDs or OTPs in console logs or front-end.
	•	Do not alter or paraphrase the legal text. It must remain verbatim.
	•	Do not store raw IP addresses without encryption.

🧾 Output Expectation
	•	Component name: ElectronicSignatureConsent.tsx
	•	Endpoint: /api/electronic-signature
	•	Database table: consent_logs
	•	Confirmation response: signatureId UUID returned to frontend
	•	Optional artifact: downloadable PDF receipt
