🧭 System Access Overview

Your platform is role-based, meaning that every user logs in through the same portal but gets redirected to a different dashboard depending on their role.

When a user logs in:

The system verifies their credentials (email/phone + password).

Based on their assigned role, they’re automatically redirected to their dedicated interface — Admin, Operator, Guesthouse Owner, or Tenant.

Each interface displays only the tools, data, and actions allowed for that role.

🔐 Login Process
Step 1: Access the Login Page

URL: yourdomain.com/login

Fields: Email / Phone, Password

Option: “Forgot Password?” for reset

Role Detection: After successful login, the system reads the user’s role from the database and redirects accordingly.

Step 2: Redirect Logic (example pseudocode)
if (role === 'Admin') redirect('/admin-dashboard');
else if (role === 'Operator') redirect('/operator-dashboard');
else if (role === 'Owner') redirect('/owner-dashboard');
else if (role === 'Tenant') redirect('/tenant-home');

🧩 How to Assign Roles

When a new user signs up, their role is stored in the database (e.g., role: "owner" or role: "tenant").
Admins can also manually assign or change roles from the Admin Dashboard → User Management section.

✅ Example User Flow

Guesthouse Owner registers → uploads ID → Operator reviews → Admin approves → gains access to Owner Dashboard.

Tenant registers → verifies ID → browses listings → books.

Operator reviews documents → flags issues or approves listings.

Admin monitors the full cycle and analytics.
