Validate complete login and session flow.

Test Case	Action	Expected Result	Fix (if needed)
Guest login	Enter email → OTP received → verified	Redirects to /welcome	Add toast “OTP sent successfully.”
Host login	Host OTP → dashboard	Loads /host/dashboard	Ensure role stored in JWT/session
Admin login	Email/password auth	Redirects /admin/dashboard	Add fallback redirect on 403
Operator login	Uses OTP login	Loads /operator/dashboard	Verify token refresh works

✅ Outcome: All dashboards accessible without blank screens.

Goal: Validate provider onboarding and visibility.
