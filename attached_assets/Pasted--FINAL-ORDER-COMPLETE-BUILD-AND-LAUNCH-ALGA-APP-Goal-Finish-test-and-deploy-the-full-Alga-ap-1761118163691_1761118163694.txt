🚀 FINAL ORDER – COMPLETE BUILD AND LAUNCH ALGA APP

Goal: Finish, test, and deploy the full Alga app (frontend + backend + database) by tomorrow. No follow-ups needed. Everything must be production-ready.

🧩 PHASE 1 – VERIFY AND COMPLETE BACKEND
1. Confirm DATABASE_URL and environment variables are valid (.env).
2. Finalize all APIs:
   - Authentication (email + phone OTP)
   - Property listings, booking, reviews
   - Service provider (cleaning, laundry, airport pickup, etc.) CRUD routes
   - Commission and payout logic (15% Alga / 85% provider)
3. Ensure SendGrid OTP and email system work correctly.
4. Test endpoints in Postman and confirm responses.

🎨 PHASE 2 – FRONTEND POLISH
1. Finalize responsive UI for:
   - Landing page (with tagline: “Stay. Discover. Belong. The Ethiopian Way.”)
   - Search, booking, and property details
   - Host dashboard
   - “Add-On Services” booking option on confirmation page
   - Admin dashboard for verification and payouts
2. Remove test data and placeholder buttons.
3. Integrate OTP and login flow with backend API.

⚙️ PHASE 3 – DATABASE & DEPLOYMENT
1. Seed initial data (test users, hosts, 3 properties, 3 service providers).
2. Connect PostgreSQL (Neon or Postgres.app) to production environment.
3. Deploy:
   - Backend → Render.com (use `npm install && npm run build` and `npm run start`)
   - Frontend → Vercel (connect same GitHub repo, set correct API_BASE_URL)
4. Configure environment variables in both platforms.

🔍 PHASE 4 – TEST & VERIFY
1. Run full end-to-end test:
   - User sign-up/login (email + phone OTP)
   - Property search and booking
   - Add service during booking
   - Admin approves provider and payout
   - Email receipts and confirmations
2. Fix any visible console or build errors.
3. Optimize load speed and ensure mobile layout is correct.

🌍 PHASE 5 – GO LIVE
1. Connect domain `algaapp.com` or temporary Render URL.
2. Display final hero message:
   **“Discover authentic Ethiopian stays — powered by Alga.”**
3. Confirm deployment, send final URL link to dashboard.

🎯 Outcome
By the end of this task, the app must be live and functional with all features enabled and verified.
No code placeholders, no unlinked buttons, no console errors.

Deadline: Complete and launch within 24 hours.
