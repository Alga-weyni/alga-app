1. Background Consent Execution
	•	Auto-trigger the signature log when a user completes a critical action (booking, registration, etc.).
	•	The act of clicking the main action button (e.g., “Confirm & Pay”) automatically performs the e-signature submission to /api/electronic-signature.
	•	No extra steps — one click = consent + transaction.

2. Inline Legal Disclosure (Micro Text)
	•	Directly beneath the button, display small, non-interruptive text:
“By confirming, you agree to the Alga Terms and consent electronically under Ethiopian law (Proclamations No. 1072/2018 & No. 1205/2020).”
	•	Font size: 12 px, muted grey.
	•	Must be visible but never require interaction.

3. API Integration Flow
	•	Each action triggers a single consolidated API call:
/api/electronic-signature → /api/[action]
	•	Signature hash and timestamp are generated automatically on the backend; the user never sees them.

4. Silent Verification Layer
	•	Before submission, verify that:
	•	The session includes a valid Fayda or OTP-verified user.
	•	The user is authenticated.
	•	If verification fails, fallback to visible consent screen.
	•	If verified, proceed silently.

5. UX Consistency
	•	“Confirm” button text never changes; the system just runs both operations (consent + core action).
	•	Add micro-delay (300 ms) to ensure hash computation finishes before transaction success message.

6. Logging
	•	Store:
	•	user_id, action, timestamp, ip_address_encrypted, device_info_encrypted, signature_hash, verified, metadata.
	•	Append signatureId to transaction record internally (not shown to user).

7. Optional Smart Receipt
	•	Generate PDF or email receipt only on request (not by default).
	•	Users can later view “Signed Transactions” under Profile → Activity → Digital Signatures.

🧾 Compliance Assurance

This one-click method remains lawful because:
	•	Consent is logically associated with the action (as per Article 6 of Proclamation 1072/2018).
	•	Identity verification + timestamped log = “reliable electronic signature” under Article 13 of Proclamation 1205/2020.
	•	Users receive ongoing notice of electronic consent in the UI (legal disclosure line).

⸻

🚫 Replit Must Avoid
	•	❌ Any modal pop-ups requesting signature separately.
	•	❌ Multiple confirmation buttons.
	•	❌ Hidden or unclear consent text.
	•	❌ Combining e-signature logic with analytics or marketing tracking.

⸻

💡 Expected Output
	•	Unified one-click flow across Host registration, Guest booking, Dellala agreements, Service provider acceptance.
	•	Logs complete automatically.
	•	Minimal text, full compliance.
	•	Seamless user experience indistinguishable from a normal confirmation.
