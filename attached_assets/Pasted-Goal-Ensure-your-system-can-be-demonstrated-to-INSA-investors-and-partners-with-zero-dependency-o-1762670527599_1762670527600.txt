Goal: Ensure your system can be demonstrated to INSA, investors, and partners with zero dependency on developers.

Actions:
	1.	✅ Finalize Data Seeder
	•	Simulate live Alga operations: 100+ listings, 50 agents, 500 transactions.
	•	Include regionally diverse data (Addis, Bishoftu, Adama).
	2.	🧾 Generate Realistic Weekly Reports
	•	Create 2–3 weeks of reports to demonstrate historical performance.
	3.	🛡️ Prepare INSA Demonstration Folder
	•	Include screenshots, system logs, and PDF samples.
	•	Add “INSA Compliance Summary” explaining data protection, encryption, and audit traceability.
	4.	🌐 Deploy Live Instance
	•	Use your Render custom domain (e.g. lemlem.alga.et).
	•	Enable PWA install prompt for offline mobile use.
	5.	📄 Prepare Demo Script
	•	Start with: “Good morning Weyni 🌤️ — System Stable.”
	•	Walk through each pillar, end with voice command: “Generate Weekly Report.”

Outcome: A fully deployable, audit-ready, investor-showcase system.

Align Lemlem with Ethiopia’s tech ecosystem:
	•	Telebirr Integration: Direct payment reconciliation
	•	EIC Collaboration: Showcase as local digital innovation case study
	•	University Partnerships: Internship or data science pipeline under Lemlem Labs

Outcome: Institutional legitimacy and tech influence — while maintaining cost-free operations.

Step 5 – Vision Expansion (2026 onward)

Position Lemlem as an African AI Operations Standard:
	•	White-label under Alga Technologies PLC for tourism, property management, logistics, or mobility startups.
	•	Offer Lemlem’s offline infrastructure as “Digital COO” software for African SMEs.
	•	Develop an “Alga Cloud” infrastructure hosted locally for Ethiopian businesses.

Step 2 – Public Visibility (Marketing + Credibility)

Once the system is live and INSA-tested, turn visibility into leverage.

Actions:
	•	Create a press-ready deck titled:
“Lemlem: Ethiopia’s First Offline AI Operations Assistant”
Include screenshots, metrics, and outcomes.
	•	Present it to:
	•	INSA showcase (for audit recognition)
	•	EIC & Innovation Fund (for tech grant consideration)
	•	Diaspora investors interested in digital infrastructure

Outcome: Credibility and positioning of Alga as a national digital innovation leader.
