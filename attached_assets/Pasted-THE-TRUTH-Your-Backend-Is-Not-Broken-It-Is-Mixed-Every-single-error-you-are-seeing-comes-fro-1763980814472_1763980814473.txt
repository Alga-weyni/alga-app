THE TRUTH — Your Backend Is Not “Broken,” It Is “Mixed”

Every single error you are seeing comes from one root problem:

👉 Your backend folder still contains:

frontend TypeScript configs

frontend-only schema fields

frontend Vite settings

mismatched drizzle schema

wrong tsconfig settings

corrupted imports

and older code that no longer matches your database structure

This is why EVERY error looks like:

“property does not exist in type…”

“type boolean not assignable…”

“cannot find @vitejs/plugin-react…”

“cannot find module @db/schema…”

These errors do not mean one thing is broken.
They mean the entire backend folder was corrupted during past refactors.

This situation cannot be fixed error-by-error.
It must be fixed structurally.

📌 WHY THESE ERRORS KEEP COMING BACK

Because TypeScript is checking your backend files and finding:

insert code using fields that DO NOT exist in your schema

schema fields that use invalid boolean→never types

import aliases pointing to frontend paths

Vite configs inside backend folder

Outdated / half-merged versions of schema.ts

Drizzle models that no longer match your database columns

These didn’t happen today.
These have been present from the moment the repo got mixed inside Replit.

Render is simply exposing them.

📌 CEO SUMMARY

This backend is like a house where:

the walls are mixed with furniture

electric wires are in the plumbing

the foundation doesn’t match the blueprint

You cannot “patch” this house.
You must restructure it.

This is not a failure — this is a normal cleanup during a product transition.

📌 YOUR TWO OPTIONS (Same as before, but now clearer)
OPTION 1 — RESET BACKEND CLEANLY (recommended)

This is the professional, scalable, stable solution.

We will:

✔ Create a new clean /server folder
✔ Move ONLY backend logic
✔ Move only valid schema models
✔ Rebuild tsconfig cleanly
✔ Rebuild Drizzle schema
✔ Rebuild index.ts & routes
✔ Rebuild storage functions properly
✔ Delete all frontend contamination
✔ Restore backend to a clean working state

After this:

All TypeScript errors disappear

Render deploys cleanly

INSA backend works

APK can connect correctly

You gain full stability
