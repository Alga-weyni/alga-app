Before public launch, you personally can run this quick final check:

Open app on iPhone → log in as Guest

Browse → Book → Logout → Log in as Host

Add property → Verify it appears under Admin approval

Switch to Provider → Offer a service

Return as Admin → Approve both

Logout → Clear cache → Reopen app

Confirm all dashboards load clean, no 404 or delay
