Now that these components are in place, the logical next step is Phase 3 — Operational Excellence & Pre-Launch Hardening.

Below is your CEO-level roadmap that builds directly on what you already completed.

⭐ Phase 3 DevOps Implementation — What You Must Do Next

This phase ensures Alga is battle-tested, audit-ready, scalable, and launch-safe.

You already have the foundation.
Now we operationalize it.

✅ 1. Activate Monitoring Dashboards

You now have /api/security/alerts and /api/metrics.
Next step: visual dashboards for leadership review.

Recommended stack (free or nearly free):

🔧 Set up dashboards for:

API latency

Error rate

CPU / Memory usage

Database response time

Wallet mismatch alerts

Failed payments

Booking and user growth metrics

Tools:

Grafana Cloud (free)

BetterStack Logs (free tier)

Render Metrics Dashboard

Outcome:
A real-time monitoring cockpit for Alga — essential before public launch.

✅ 2. Implement Alerting & On-Call Rotations

Now that you have metrics, you need active alerting.

Alerts to configure:

🌋 P1: App down / Payment system failure

🔥 P2: Database latency / high memory

⚠️ P3: Failed reconciliations

🕵🏽 Security anomaly (multiple failed logins, IP spikes)

Delivery channels:

WhatsApp

Slack / Telegram

Email

Outcome:
Issues reach you BEFORE users experience them.

✅ 3. Conduct a Full Disaster Recovery Drill

You have the scripts. Now simulate a real outage.

Test:

DB restore from backup

Rollback deployment

Reconciliation after restore

Failover simulation

Payment retry logic

This must be documented as a DR Report for:

INSA

Banks

Investors

Internal governance

Target: Recovery in under 1 hour.

✅ 4. Harden Payment Infrastructure (Critical)

Your reconciliation script exists — now ensure payment correctness.

You need:

✔ Daily automated reconciliation

✔ Wallet mismatch alert triggers
✔ Ledger immutability check
✔ Failed settlement detection
✔ Retry logic for gateway failures

This is what gives Alga bank-level financial reliability.

✅ 5. Create a Pre-Launch Checklist (docs/PRELAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md)

Items should include:

Technical

All tests passing

Security scan clean

Backups healthy

API latency < 200ms

Database load < 70%

Operations

Runbook approved

On-call schedule active

Escalation contacts tested

Product

App Store listing ready

Internal onboarding complete

Critical workflows tested (booking, payment, messaging, reconciliation)

Compliance

INSA submission validated

Data retention policies applied

Logging systems functioning

✅ 6. Strengthen Branch Protection Rules

Now enforce DevOps governance.

In GitHub:

No direct pushes to main

At least 1 code review required

All tests must pass

All security scans must pass

Only authorized personnel can approve deployments

Outcome:
Stable, predictable releases.

✅ 7. Schedule Monthly DevOps Tasks

Create a recurring cycle:

Monthly:

Disaster recovery simulation

Dependency upgrades

Vulnerability scans

Payment audit

Load test

API documentation updates

Quarterly:

Penetration testing

Infrastructure review

Cost optimization check

⭐ CEO Summary — You’re Entering Maturity Level 3

You’ve moved from:

Phase 1: DevOps Setup →
Phase 2: DevOps Operationalization →
Now stepping into:
Phase 3: DevOps Excellence & Audit Readiness

This level of discipline is rare among Ethiopian startups.
It positions Alga as:

A serious, scalable tech platform

Compliant with INSA, banks, and international standards

Ready for investment

Safe for public launch
