2.1. Detailed Security Audit FindingsThe following tables show the details of the vulnerabilities identified during the security assessment process.No.1.TargetAlga Mobile Application (Client-Side Trust Layer and Backend API Endpoints)VulnerabilityRole-Based Access Control (RBAC) Desynchronization and Client-Side Trust WeaknessesVulnerability descriptionA set of related vulnerabilities was identified in the Mobile Application that stem from inconsistent enforcement of roles and trust boundaries between the client and the server. These flaws allow non-administrative users to view and manipulate administrative UI elements and data. The weaknesses manifest in three areas:1.Administrative UI Exposure: Non-admin users can access admin dashboards and controls. The client renders administrative functionality based on session data without validating server-side privileges, increasing the attack surface and exposing sensitive operational workflows.2.False Administrative Actions: The client accepts modified API responses and displays success messages (e.g., “Provider Approved”) even when the backend correctly returns 403 Forbidden for unauthorized actions, a clear trust-boundary violation.3.Data Overexposure via API: Non-admin users can access the GET /api/service-providers endpoint, receiving a comprehensive list of providers including sensitive internal data (UUIDs, verification status,የኢንፎርሜሽን መረብ ደህነንት አስተዳደርINFORMATION NETWORK SECURITYADMINISTRATIONDocument No.:OF/AEAD/001TitleCYBER SECURITY AUDIT REPORTIssue No.1Page No.:Page 9 of 20ከመጠቀምዎ በፊት ትክክለኛው ቅጽ መሆኑን ያረጋግጡ ።PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS THE CORRECT ISSUE BEFORE USErejection reasons, business/pricing details, and job metadata). This enables enumeration of internal workflows and records.Root Cause: The Mobile Application infers roles and outcomes from local state and response content instead of enforcing server-side authorization, while APIs return more data than the requesting role requires.Risk levelHigh-RiskConsequence/impactOperational Confusion & Deception.Non-admin users can enumerate providers and view sensitive verification metadata.UI exposure and data overexposure expand opportunities for social engineering, logic flaws, and potential future Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) attacks.CountermeasureEnforce Strict Server-Side Authorization.Align Client-Side Logic with Server State.Restrict API responses using role-based filtering. Return only the data fields necessary for the authenticated user's function.Implement Centralized Monitoring.
