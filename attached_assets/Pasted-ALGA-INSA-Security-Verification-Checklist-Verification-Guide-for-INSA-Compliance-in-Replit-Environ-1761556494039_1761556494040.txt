ALGA – INSA Security Verification Checklist
Verification Guide for INSA Compliance in Replit Environment
This document provides a clear, step-by-step procedure to verify and maintain INSA
security compliance for the Alga platform within the Replit development environment. It
confirms alignment with Ethiopia’s national cybersecurity standards and the 11 required
protection layers validated through INSA’s auditing tools (Nmap, Nessus, Burp Suite,
OWASP ZAP, and Wireshark).
1■■ Confirm Middleware Setup
Ensure the insa-hardening.js file is present under /server/security/ and includes the
following active layers of protection:
1 Helmet – Secure HTTP headers
2 CORS – Controlled cross-origin access
3 XSS Clean – Blocks malicious scripts
4 Mongo Sanitize – Prevents NoSQL injection
5 HPP – Protects against HTTP parameter pollution
6 Rate Limiter – DoS protection
7 Compression – Performance and bandwidth optimization
8 HSTS – Forces HTTPS connections
9 Morgan – Audit logging for all access
10 CSP – Content Security Policy
11 Automatic HTTPS redirection
2■■ Run the INSA Verification Checklist
On Replit console, run the following tests:
1 Run `npm audit` – verify all dependencies are secure.
2 Run `npm run start` – confirm '■ INSA Security Hardening Enabled' appears in
console.
3 Ensure HTTP requests redirect automatically to HTTPS.
4 Attempt duplicated parameters (e.g., /api?price=100&price;=200) – should block.
5 Inject scripts (alert(1)) – should be sanitized instantly.
3■■ Enable Audit Logs
Verify that morgan logging is active. All access and error logs must appear under Replit’s
Shell console, reflecting active monitoring.
4■■ Optional – Vulnerability Scan
Run OWASP ZAP or INSA testing suite to simulate vulnerabilities. Alga should resist XSS,
SQL/NoSQL injections, and insecure header attempts.
5■■ Maintain Weekly Compliance
Schedule weekly security checks:
1 Run `npm audit` every week.
2 Use Replit Secrets Manager for all environment variables.
3 Deploy updates with `npm install → npm run build → npm run start`.
4 Keep NODE_ENV set to 'production' for full enforcement.
6■■ INSA-Ready Passing Criteria
1 HTTPS-only access enforced.
2 All security headers validated.
3 XSS, SQL, and NoSQL injections blocked.
4 Audit logs visibly active.
5 `npm audit` shows 0 vulnerabilities.
Once all checks are completed and validated, Alga is officially INSA-ready and compliant
with Ethiopia’s cybersecurity standards.
