## SLIDE 1: The Problem

### Ethiopian Businesses Face Three Critical Challenges

1. **Unreliable Internet** 📡
   - 2G/3G networks dominate outside Addis Ababa
   - Frequent outages disrupt operations
   - Cloud-dependent software fails when offline

2. **Foreign Cloud Lock-In** 💸
   - Monthly costs: $500-2,000/month for SaaS tools
   - Data sovereignty concerns
   - Dependency on foreign payment processors

3. **Manual Operations** 📋
   - Excel spreadsheets for tracking
   - No real-time insights
   - No predictive warnings
   - Hours wasted on report generation

**Result**: Ethiopian SMEs operate blind, expensive, and inefficiently.
